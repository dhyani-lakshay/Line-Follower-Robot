# Line-Follower-Robot
This project is a simple Line Follower Robot built using an Arduino Uno, three IR sensors, an L298P motor driver shield, two DC motors, one castor wheel, and a self-made hardboard chassis. The robot uses the IR sensors to detect a black line on the floor and follows it by controlling the motors accordingly.
